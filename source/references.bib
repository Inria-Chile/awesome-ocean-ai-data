  abstract = {Species interaction networks are shaped by abiotic and biotic
                 factors. Here, as part of the Tara Oceans project, we studied
                 the photic zone interactome using environmental factors and
                 organismal abundance profiles and found that environmental
                 factors are incomplete predictors of community structure. We
                 found associations across plankton functional types and
                 phylogenetic groups to be nonrandomly distributed on the
                 network and driven by both local and global patterns. We
                 identified interactions among grazers, primary producers,
                 viruses, and (mainly parasitic) symbionts and validated
                 network-generated hypotheses using microscopy to confirm
                 symbiotic relationships. We have thus provided a resource to
                 support further research on ocean food webs and integrating
                 biological components into ocean models.},
